# GLUE Benchmark

The code in glue/run_glue.py was used to run the GLUE benchmark. This directory contains GLUE results for our models.

The script glue/evaluate_glue.py is used to evaluate the results per model and to plot with [plots.py](https://github.com/cleolotta/fair-and-private-lm/blob/main/code/plots.py)
